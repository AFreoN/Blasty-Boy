# Blasty-Boy
A compelling action game where players control the anchor point of a throwing blade. By sliding to set the blade's trajectory and releasing to throw, players aim to eliminate all enemies in each level using a finite set of blades. Completing a level requires precision and strategic planning, demanding player skill and offering an engaging gameplay experience.
